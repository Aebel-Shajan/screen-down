# Screen Down : Compete to unlplug
Compete with friends to see who can spend the least time on their screen.


## The problem
I use my phone way too much, averaging around 5 hours of screen time per day. 

## The solution
I had been using this other app called step-up, which was a super fun way to reach my daily step count of 10,000 by competing with friends. I figuired with this app I can harness mine and my friends competitive spirit to reduce our screen time.
